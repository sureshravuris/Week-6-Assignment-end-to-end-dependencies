# Project Title: Dynamic Data Distribution Impact Analysis on Model Performance

## Overview

This project is designed to explore and demonstrate the effects of data distribution changes on the performance of machine learning models. Utilizing a comprehensive approach that includes data manipulation (up-sampling and down-sampling), feature importance analysis, and dynamic visualization, users can gain insights into how different distributions impact model accuracy and reliability. This project is ideal for those interested in data science, machine learning model evaluation, and interactive visualization.

## Key Deliverables

1. **Technical Write-up**: Update your technical documentation with a detailed description of the project's objectives, methodologies, and findings. This documentation should cover the following aspects:
   - Introduction to data distributions and their significance in model performance.
   - Steps for creating a dashboard that enables the modification of data distributions for selected features.
   - Implementation of the muller loop to analyze the impact on model outcomes.
   - Analysis of model performance through dynamic confusion matrix visualization based on data distribution changes.

2. **Dynamic Visualization and Interactive Dashboard**: Implement an interactive dashboard following the guidelines provided in the [Visualization and Interactive Dashboard in Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/visualization-and-interactive-dashboard-in-python-c2f2a88b2ba3) article, tailored to your dataset. Key features include:
   - A slider to modify the distribution of a selected feature.
   - Real-time updates of the confusion matrix and other relevant metrics (e.g., F1 score, R2 score) as the data distribution changes.
   - Selection of important features for up-sampling or down-sampling based on criteria such as Gini score, feature importance, or SHAP values.
   - Recomputation of model performance using a variety of algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, MLP, RandomForest, SVM) as the data distribution changes.

## Additional Tips

- Consider using SMOTE for up-sampling and down-sampling to address data imbalance.
- Focus on identifying and modifying the distribution of key features that significantly impact model performance.
- Train your models within a muller loop to efficiently compare different algorithms based on your selected metrics.
- Utilize dynamic plotting and visualization tools to make the analysis more interactive and informative.
- Ensure your documentation includes step-by-step instructions for operating the dashboard, modifying data distributions, and interpreting the results.
